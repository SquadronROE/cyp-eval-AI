#### EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS

Our previous automation engineer is on sabbatical but was previously involved in writing a set of tests in Cypress for our new banking app. The app can be built following the instructions in the root-level README file,
along with basic information on the tech stack involved.

Using whatever toolset you would like, please complete his work!

At the end of the evaluation period, we're looking for you to:

* Fix any broken tests
* Finish any noted TO DOs
* Add any tests that might be stubbed out
* Add any missing tests
* Become familiar with the authentication methodology and the database the app uses

You can complete these tasks in any order you'd like, but your ultimate goal is to get the app as close to fully tested as possible in the time given.

Some tips:

* Some of the tests might initially pass but not provide meaningful validation
* Read the README.md in the root directory carefully on how to run the app locally
* Feel free to use any resources you'd like to complete the test
